      This plugin aims to speed up the process of converting Figma design tokens
      into a Tailwind theme.

      <ProjectHeading>Origin Story</ProjectHeading>
      <p>
        <em>Figma</em> is a design tool that I tend to use quite often. When I learned
        about the Figma team releasing a dev mode <em>VSCode</em> plugin, it got
        me excited about possible integrations. Around that time, I was also into
        doing <a
          class="underline underline-offset-2"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a
        > challenges. This practice mainly consisted of taking Figma designs and
        implementing them with <em>React</em> and <em>Tailwind</em>. Each time I
        started a new project, I found myself repeatedly copying design tokens
        from Figma into my Tailwind theme. That made me think, wouldn't it be
        great to have a tool that could do it for me?

      <ProjectSubheading>Learning Figma Internals</ProjectSubheading>
      <p>
        As this was my first Figma plugin, I had to learn a lot about Figma's
        Plugin API, its security, and release policy. While working on this, I
        discovered a bunch of internal quirks and deepened my understanding of
        two primary features used for design tokens in Figma,
        <em>Styles</em> and <em>Variables</em>.
      </p>
      <ProjectSubheading>ES6 Target</ProjectSubheading>
      <p>
        Figma's plugin environment supports the ES6 target. Before this project,
        I always targeted evergreen browsers while using the latest JS features.
        During this project, I came to realize that some built-in syntax I'd
        been taking for granted didn't exist in ES6 yet and also it cannot be
        transpiled to it. Hence, I had to work around it by using alternatives.
        In the end, it wasn't hard but definitely caught me by surprise. I
        always thought code like <code>Object.entries()</code> must have been part
        of JS forever.
      </p>
      <ProjectSubheading>Cross-Origin Communication</ProjectSubheading>
      <p>
        Due to security reasons, plugins in Figma usually consist of two parts.
        The first is the Figma plugin code, which runs inside a <em>QuickJS</em>
        sandbox and has very limited access to browser APIs. The second part is the
        UI of a plugin, a web app with complete access to the browser but effectively
        no access to Figma's APIs. Because of this division of labor, in order for
        the plugin to work as a unit, these parts must communicate. As they run each
        inside of a different origin, information must be exchanged via the <code
          >window.postMessage</code
        > API. This was my first time implementing cross-origin communication, and
        even though it had some intricacies, it was a lot of fun. It reminded me
        of my networking job at Red Hat.

      <p>
        This was not the biggest project I have ever done, but it was quite
        different from what I had been working on before. It taught me a lot
        about the Figma development environment and I got to use techniques like
        cross-origin communication between windows, which was cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm planning to keep working on this. As the next step, I'd like to
        extend the range of tokens the plugin is able to convert. I hope that
        more users will find this project useful as it grows in features.
