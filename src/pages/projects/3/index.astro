        This Plugin aims to speed up process of converting Figma design tokens
        into a Tailwind Theme.

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">Origin story</h1>
        <p>
          <em>Figma</em> if not my daily driver, it is definitely a design tool which
          I tend to use the most. When I learned about Figma Team releasing a dev
          mode
          <em>Vscode</em> plugin, it got me excited about possible integrations.
          Around that time I was also into doing <a

            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a
          > challenges. This practice mainly consisted of taking figma designs and
          implementing them with <em>React</em> and <em>Tailwind</em>. Each time
          I started new project I found myself repeatedly copying design tokens
          from Figma into my Tailwind Theme. That made me think, wouldn't it be
          great to have a tool which could do it for me?

        <h2 class="text-xl font-extrabold">Learning Figma internals</h2>
        <p>
          As this was my first Figma plugin, I had to learn a bunch about
          Figma's Plugin API, its security and release policy. While working on
          this I discovered bunch of internal quirks and deepened my
          understanding of two primary features used for design tokens in Figma,
          <em>Styles</em> and <em>Variables</em>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-extrabold">ES6 target</h2>
        <p>
          Figma's Plugin environment supports ES6 target. Before this project I
          always targeted evergreen browsers while using latest JS features.
          During this project I came to realize that some builtin syntax I'd
          been taking for granted didn't exist in ES6 yet and also it cannot be
          transpiled to it. Hence I had to work around it by using alternatives.
          In the end it wasn't hard but definitely caught me by a surprise. I
          always thought code like <code>Object.entries()</code> must have been part
          of JS forever.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-extrabold">Cross-origin communication</h2>
        <p>
          Due to security reasons plugins in Figma usually consists of two
          parts. First is a Figma Plugin code which is running inside <em
            >QuickJS</em
          > sandbox and has very limited access to browser APIs. The second part
          is the UI of a plugin, a web app with complete access to browser but effectively
          no access to Figma's APIs. Because of this division of labour, in order
          for plugin to work as a unit these parts must communicate. As they run
          each inside of different origin, information must be exchanged via
          <code>window.postMessage</code> API. This was my first time I was implementing
          cross origin communication, and even though it had some intricacies it
          was a lot of fun. It reminded me my networking job in Red Hat.

          This was not a biggest project I ever done, but it was quite different
          from what I had been working on before. It taught me a lot about Figma
          development environment, and about open source as such. I got to also
          learn about techniques like cross-origin communication which was quite
          cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan to keep working on this, especially on extending the range of
          tokens it will be possible to convert. I have hopes that more users find this 
          project useful as it will grow in features.
